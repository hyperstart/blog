We are two developers who truly believe in Hyperapp's capacity to change the JavaScript landscape. We built Hyperstart because we saw a lot of potential to develop ways to make programming faster and easier, by using this new framework and building devtools on top of our development platform.

Here in this blog you will find tips, best practices, tutorials, and ramblings on JavaScript, start-up life, progressive web applications, and what's next on the world of tiny frameworks.
